Hello everyone! A short term goal that I'd love to share would be to eventually obtain the status and title of becoming a Principal Engineer, or potentially a Vice President of Software Engineering. Because I’ve upheld a strong ambition, commitment, and diligence from the beginning of my college years towards it’s end in accomplishing a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice – I highly believe I can confidently complete my endeavors with Per Scholas and produce my passions to be the therapeutic, the promising and reformational software engineer society will highly need. Because I hold objectiveness, open-mindedness, and analytical awareness, all strengths would be essence and key for proper cognitive decisions to be made – unlocking strategies, techniques and formulas to be catered successfully within the field of Software Engineering. My goal is to be the leader, role-model guidance and presence, where I uplift prominent positive reformation practices that’s needed for organizations to prosper. My goal is to carry stability through the power of unification, and pathway forward discovery establishments, for all future project endeavors to transition flawlessly within Software Engineering.
